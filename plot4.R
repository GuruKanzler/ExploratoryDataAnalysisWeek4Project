# R code to answer the following question:
#   Across the United States, how have emissions from coal 
#   combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# Library
library(ggplot2)

# Read data
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Find relevant SCC's. "ccs" = coal combustion sources.

# Subset NEI based on relevant SSC's. "efc" = emissions from coal.
efc <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% ccs$SCC,]

# Plotting coal combustion related emissions per year. (Optional)
